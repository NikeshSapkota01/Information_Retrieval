# Information_Retrieval

Create a vertical search engine similar to Google Scholar that only returns papers/books published
by Coventry University members. That is, at least one of the co-authors must be from CU. For this
purpose, you crawl Google Scholar profiles of CU academic employees and index their articles in
their profiles. The Google Scholar page for Coventry University is the seed page for your crawler,
or the initial page to crawl
